# Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model
In this work I implement a monte carlo simulation of the two-dimensional Ising model on a square lattice.

See `assignment3.pdf` for further details on the specifications guiding implementation and `Peter_Akioyamen_250949002_AS3.pdf` for completed analysis. `C++` and `matlab` were used.
